When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when not only me is working on the files or when i want to have a master branch always running

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

because i want that in the repository on github only stays the version that is always running and i will only push information when i am 100% sure, it runs on my computer, so that the people how may want to check out my repository are not able to find an error or a bug

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks : are cloned repositorys that have place on the cloud in Github, directly linked from the original one, even though the changes, that can be made on the copy can't have any effect on the original one unless the admin of this repository decides to pull this changes to his master branch

clones : are cloned repositorys that have local place only in the computer, the original one can be either on the cloud or on other computer, furthermore their changes can not affect the original files unless the admin of it says so

branches: a branch is a master version that shows the result product of all the changes, that we may have made on it

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

that we are able to fetch the changes that can be made on the remote, only because it will always remember the last posicion of the origin/master locally, that means it knows exactly which version of the master was pushed up last time to the cloud and it helps to make you able to merge the new fetched origin/master into the locally master

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

i would not do it without them, it would be to hard
